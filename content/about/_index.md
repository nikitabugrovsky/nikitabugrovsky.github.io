**Hello!**

I'm Nikita, a Principal Software Engineer currently working at Red Hat in Israel.
I'm passionate about building and refining technology, with a special interest in DevOps,
cloud infrastructure, hyperscalers, and open-source projects. Throughout my career,
- I've had the opportunity to work with a range of tools like Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform and many more.
- I've also been involved in designing various CI/CD pipelines.
- I've been building applications in Python, Golang and Ruby.
- I've been building monitoring and alerting solutions.
- I've led initiatives to improve system availability and efficiency.

I consider myself an open-minded and motivated engineer, always eager to learn from others and contribute to innovative projects.
This blog is where I'll be sharing some of the knowledge I've gained along the way.
